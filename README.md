-> The project should be a web application consisting of a front end, back end and a database server.

-> The language to be used for backend should be NodeJs which is based on JavaScript.

-> The Server can be as simple as you want (be sure it is capable of receiving an HTTP request, making a query to database and sending the response back to the client).
You can use the Chrome application Postman to test your backend.

-> The database can be chosen by you. For simplicity you can choose MySql. There should be minimum one table and the backend must perform minimum one query on the database.

->There should be min one rest call such as an AJAX call between frontend and back end.

This rest call can be a GET call or POST call. No need to go beyond it.
Using rest call, some request must be sent from front end to backend. The backend should fetch some data from database and return the data as a response to the front end Client.

-> Due to limited time, we don't expect you to make a great visually attractive frontend Client.The front end should be able to send an HTTP request using GET/POST REST call, receive the response and display it.

-> You are not expected to use high levels of CSS . Use Javascript  to make the rest calls from front end.Try to construct simple and flat Html structure.

-> The project theme will be decided by you. Please come up with your suggestions and get it validated by us. Choose a simple project. Try not complicating things. You can improve upon them later.

For the theme, 'Sustainability' is the one we recommend, but feel free to go beyond it.

Bonus tasks: 
->Use Ubuntu for development as you will have to work on it after the project.

-> Code should be updated on Github regularly so that we can track your progress and support you wherever required.Share the link with us.

-> If you don't want to use Github, you may use simple apps like Google Drive. We recommend Git, as it'll be used by you in any case after the completion of the project.mash_orientation
